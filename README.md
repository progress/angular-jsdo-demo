This project contains a node.js server that takes data from an OpenEdge Mobile service and converts it to json. It will respond to any HTTP request by serving this json data. In addition, it contains a separate instance of Node in the StaticNodeServer directory that serves an AngularJS webpage which gets it data from the first node server.
