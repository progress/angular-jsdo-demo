### Project Description
This project contains a node.js server that takes data from an OpenEdge Mobile service exposed with the jsdo protocol, then converts and exposes the data in json form. It will respond to any HTTP request by serving this json data. To show off this functionality, the project contains a static instance of node that requests this json data and displays it in the browser in a formatted table using AngularJS.

### Project Directories
